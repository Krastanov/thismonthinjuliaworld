# Directions on helping with contributions for the newsletter:

- First, thanks for helping\!
- Just follow the already existing formatting. Please do not paste raw links, rather use formatted text with hyperlinks (they will get automatically converted to markdown when posting).
- When linking, do not use the style “you can register [here](#)” rather use “you [can register](#)”. Another example: Bad: “see the package [here](#)” | Good: “see the [package](#)”
- If there are a ton of related links, just use a citation style like “\[[1](#), [2](#), [3](#)\]” or “\[[pr](#), [discourse](#), [slack](#)\]”
- **Do not add links to package repositories unless there is something new happening.** If you want to post about your own package that has existed for a while, please first make a discourse post about it, and link to that discourse post, so that there is some context and a venue for discussion.
